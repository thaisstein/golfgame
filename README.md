# Mini Golf Game
Mini golf game project that was completed as part of the "Architecture de Moteur et Jeux Vidéo" class in 2023. 

## Objective
Develop a mini golf game, incorporating physics, UI, and UX principles.

##Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the "Architecture de Moteur et Jeux Vidéo" class in 2023. Here's a summary of the implemented topics:

- I - Initial Project Setup
Created a 3D project called "MiniGolf."
Organized project folders for a clean structure.
Added game elements: "Floor," "GolfBall," and "Wall," each with distinct colors.

- II - Basic Movement
Implemented gravity for the "GolfBall."
Developed a script for applying adjustable force using the spacebar (Putting).
Utilized a Physics Material to enable wall collisions.
Enabled camera following the golf ball.
Allowed camera rotation with Q/D keys and arrow keys.
Aligned "Putting" with the camera's direction.

- III - Game Loop
Created prefab objects: "Hole" and "Start."
Implemented victory message when the "GolfBall" reaches the "Hole."
Enabled "GolfBall" respawn at "Start" when it goes out of bounds.
Provided the ability for the player to reset the ball position using the "R" key.
Designed and incorporated two additional playable levels.
Implemented level transitions.

- IV - Main Menu & Victory Menu (Future Enhancements)
Main Menu integration, with a "Start," "Select Level," and "Quit" buttons.


This project demonstrates the initial steps in developing a mini golf game, with a focus on physics, user interface, and user experience.
